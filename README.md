# birdsongbot
building a sweet tweetbot

### Making BirdSongBot work ###
-Open authtemplate.py and save your consumer access keys in each of the fields. Then, save the file and rename it "authkeys.py"
#
-Run the start.py python script to start the bot!
#
#
# Depending on your OS you may need to change the os.system calls throughout the start.py python script (We're working on fixing this)


##Happy Haikuing!!
