## About (for real)

We dreamed up Birdsong as a collaborative art experience, with a vision to connect people through poetry. Twitter is a medium that allows people from all around the world to talk to each other, but it falls short of real human connection. We wanted to bridge this gap by creating a bot that would give friends on the internet a real voice -- through poetry. When installed, people could gather around Birdsong and hear poetry sent to them from around the world. Together, we're art.

## Features

* Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) thanks to PyTTSx3
* Easy to setup
* Customizable via config.ini
* Spam filter and abuse filter built in
* Cool as heck!!

## How to use

Create a [Twitter](https://twitter.com) account, and open the Twitter Developer console. Obtain a consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret. Add these keys, and the username of the Twitter account you created, into the config.ini file.

Create an [Indico](https://indico.io) account. Get an API key. Add this to config.ini as well.

In the root directory, install all required modules by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

You should now be all set! Start the bot with `python start.py`. Happy Haikuing!!
